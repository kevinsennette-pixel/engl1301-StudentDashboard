                        In 2025, Lamar CISD opened Tomas High School(along with a full system of schools), fundamentally changing the educational landscape for  of students in Richmond and Rosenberg, Texas. This project explores the question: <span class="emerald-text bold">How did the construction of Tomas High School transform the educational experience and daily life for students and families who previously attended Foster High School?</span>

                        Gene Tomas High School, named after Foster High School's beloved former principal, represents more than just a new building. It symbolizes the district's response to rapid population growth in Fort Bend County, where families have been moving in record numbers seeking quality education and proximity to Houston's job market. The school's opening in August 2025 marked the culmination of five years of planning, community input, and construction that began with the 2020 bond approval.

                    <p class="text-large">

                        The project was not without controversy. Community members debated the location, only three miles from Foster, questioning whether resources might have been better allocated to expanding existing facilities or building farther from established schools. Others worried about the financial burden on taxpayers and the impact of redistricting on neighborhood friendships and school traditions. Despite these concerns, district leaders moved forward, convinced that the long-term benefits of addressing overcrowding would outweigh the short-term disruptions.

                        <p>
                            The redistricting resulted in approximately 500 students moving from Foster to Tomas for the 2025-2026 school year. According to interviews with recent Foster graduates, the school had been operating at 125% capacity, with hallways so crowded that students had to strategically position themselves before the bell rang to avoid being late to their next class. The portable classrooms added to accommodate overflow enrollment created their own challenges, particularly during inclement weather when students struggled to navigate between temporary and permanent structures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Foster High School was originally designed for around 2,000 students when it opened in 2001. By 2025, enrollment had swelled to nearly 2,600 students, straining every aspect of the facility from cafeteria capacity to parking availability. Teachers reported difficulty managing larger class sizes, and students described feeling like "just a number" in the overcrowded environment. The opening of Tomas promised relief not just in terms of numbers, but in the quality of educational experience both schools could provide with more manageable enrollment levels.

                        <h3>Academic Concerns</h3>
                            <p>
                                Beyond the physical and financial aspects of the transition, families faced significant concerns about academic continuity. Foster High School had built a strong reputation for its dual credit program, offering enough college-level courses that motivated students could graduate with an associate's degree alongside their high school diploma. This program represented a major financial benefit for families and an academic advantage for college-bound students. The uncertainty about whether Tomas would offer comparable opportunities created anxiety among families being redistricted.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As Isam Abawadeh noted in his interview, counselors at Tomas initially told students and families to "pick the classes, and if enough people pick it, we'll get a teacher for it." This wait-and-see approach made planning difficult, especially for students entering their junior or senior years when dual credit enrollment typically peaks. Families had to weigh the benefits of a brand-new facility and shorter commute against the proven track record and established programs at Foster. For some, like Isam's younger brother, the choice was made by the district's redistricting decision. For others, the option to remain at Foster through athletic participation created difficult family decisions about priorities and logistics.

                        The redistricting process proved to be one of the most contentious aspects of Tomas High School's opening. In April 2024, the Lamar CISD Attendance Boundary Committee held public meetings where families learned whether their neighborhoods would remain in the Foster zone or shift to Tomas. The decisions were based on multiple factors: geographic proximity, traffic patterns, existing neighborhood school relationships, and the goal of balancing enrollment between the two campuses.

                        Neighborhoods like Parkway Lakes, located closer to the new Tomas campus, were reassigned despite years of established connections to Foster. Students who had grown up expecting to attend Foster alongside their older siblings suddenly faced a different future. The district offered limited exceptions, primarily for students participating in varsity athletics, but even those families had to arrange their own transportation if they chose to remain at Foster rather than transfer to Tomas.

                        The map below shows the current high school attendance zones for Lamar CISD. Foster High School (shown in yellow/tan) retained its central coverage area, while Tomas High School (shown in green) serves the northern developing regions. The boundary decisions reflected not just current population distribution but also projections for future growth, as the Richmond area continues to see rapid residential development with hundreds of new homes under construction.

            Tomas High School's construction cannot be understood in isolation from the broader transformation of Richmond and Rosenberg. Over the past decade, Fort Bend County has been one of the fastest-growing regions in Houston, with families attracted by its combination of suburban affordability, excellent schools, and reasonable commute distance to Houston's commercial and medical sectors.

                        Both students interviewed for this project noted the dramatic visible changes in their neighborhoods. Bryce McNeil reported that approximately 700 new homes have been built or are under construction in his immediate area alone. Isam Abawadeh described watching wooded areas near his home being cleared and replaced with apartment complexes and gated communities, all within the same two-year timeframe as Tomas's construction.
                    </p>
                    <p class="dev-text">
                        This synchronicity was not coincidental, district planners had been tracking development permits and population projections for years, timing the school's opening to coincide with the influx of new families. The northern parts of Richmond, where Tomas is located, saw the most dramatic transformation as agricultural land and scattered residential areas gave way to master-planned communities and multi-family housing developments.

                    <p class="dev-text">
                        The infrastructure changes extended beyond the school itself. FM 723, a major thoroughfare running near the Tomas campus, underwent significant improvements including new traffic signals and turn lanes designed to handle increased school-related traffic. Previously a relatively straight road with few intersections, FM 723 now features multiple controlled access points that improve safety for student drivers and school buses.
                    </p>
                    <p class="dev-text">
                        These improvements, funded through a combination of district, county, and state resources, represent millions of dollars in additional investment tied to the school's opening. The road modifications also benefit the broader community, managing the flow of commuters using FM 723 to reach Highway 59 and other major routes. Local residents noted that the new intersections, while initially causing construction delays, ultimately improved access to previously underserved neighborhoods.

                                These perspectives reveal an important truth about school transitions: timing matters enormously. For students already invested in Foster's community, with established friend groups and knowledge of the school's systems, the disruption of switching schools outweighed the benefits of newer facilities. But for students just beginning their high school journey, Tomas offered an opportunity to be part of something new, to establish traditions rather than inherit them, and to benefit from state-of-the-art facilities from day one.

                    <p class="text-large">
                        As of December 2025, Tomas High School has been open for only around four months. The full impact of its opening remains to be seen. Will Foster thrive with its reduced enrollment and retain its strong academic programs, or will budget cuts and decreased attention from the district diminish its standing? Will Tomas successfully establish its own identity and traditions, or will it always exist in Foster's shadow as "the new school"? These questions cannot yet be answered definitively.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-large">
                        What is clear from the interviews conducted for this project is that the human experience of educational change is complex and multifaceted. The same decision, building a new high school, simultaneously solved problems and created new challenges. It relieved overcrowding while straining district finances. It provided modern facilities while disrupting established communities. It offered opportunities for some students while forcing difficult transitions on others.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-large">
                        The students who spoke for this project, both members of Foster's Class of 2025, graduated just before Tomas opened. They experienced the worst of Foster's overcrowding without benefiting from the relief Tomas would provide. Their perspective is therefore unique, they can speak to the conditions that necessitated change while also observing, from the outside, the results of that change on their younger siblings and former schoolmates. Their mixed feelings about Tomas's necessity and location reflect the broader community ambivalence about rapid growth and change.

                    <p class="text-large">
                        The story of Tomas High School is ultimately a story about growth, both its opportunities and its costs. As Richmond continues to develop, as more families move to the area seeking the quality of life that attracted those before them, Lamar CISD will face continued pressure to expand and adapt. Whether Tomas represents a sustainable model for managing that growth, or whether the district will find itself in five years planning yet another new high school, remains an open question. For now, two high schools serve where one stood before, and hundreds of students navigate the reality of that change every day.
